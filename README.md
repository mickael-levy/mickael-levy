- <h1>👋 Hi, hope this finds you well! </h1>

   I've worked on web and software developer in the past so I can certainly help you with my skills.

🌱🌱 A little more about me...

   I'm a Italy based full stack developer with 10 years of experience. 
   I've been building websites since 2012 and mobile apps, iOS and Android, for 4 years now. 
   I've built tech for large companies like K Systems Ltd and NOVAXLESS TECHNOLOGY. 
   So I have a lot of experience working with preexisting code under tight deadlines.

   Almost 20 years of development means that I've seen most problems and bugs. 
   Allowing me to prevent issues before they happen and fix the ones that do much faster than a less experienced developer.

   I take pride in my work and hold myself to the highest professional standards. 
   Clear, frequent, honest communication and delivering high quality, clean, documented and scalable code on time has allowed me to grow my consulting practice.
